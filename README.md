# e_commerce

**Framework used:**
Symfony 5.3
PHP 7.2
MySQL

I have chosen Symfony 5.3 because this is the latest version of Symfony. But I have experience with Symfony all versions after v2.8.
I have used MySQL for databases. For Doctrine I used Yaml instead of annotations. But I can work with both Yaml and annotations. 
Routing, I used Yaml as well. 

**Entities:**
1. Customer
2. CustomerAddress
3. CustomerOrder
4. OrderProductDetail
5. PaymentMethod


I used key for API URL. But it's up to us how we can secure the system in any other way. 
I used the customer key to get the current order and its status.  But we can use the order key or any other option to track orders. 

I have tried to solve all issues mentioned in the requirements.
