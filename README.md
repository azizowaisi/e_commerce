# e_commerce
I have chosen Symfony 5.3, because this is latest version of symfony. I have experience from v2.8. I have SQL for database. 
Yaml files for doctrine but I can work on annotations. 

Entities;
1. Customer
2. CustomerAddress
3. CustomerOrder
4. OrderProductDetail
5. PaymentMethod


I have used key for API url. 
I used customer key to get current order and its status. It up to us if you want to see it orderwise or userwise.
